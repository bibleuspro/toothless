            <p>The first time you run a new application, the application must be downloaded, which might take a few minutes. Later launches of this application will be speedier.</p>

            <p>Also, if an application receives an update, it will need to be downloaded. These are typically briefer than the initial installation download.</p>

            <p>If you see an error in red above, however, the application launch has been halted and will not proceed.</p>
